# Instructions for the Max version of the Fluid Corpus Manipulation toolbox

## How to start:

1) move the full FluidCorpusManipulation folder in your Packages folder (~/Documents/Max/Packages/), and restart Max.

There is now an 'extras' giving the overview of the toolbox, and a shortcut (shift-f) to create fluid.* objects. Full documentation, and examples, are also available.

#### Enjoy!
